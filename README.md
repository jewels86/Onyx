# Onyx
## Versioning
Onyx uses a derivative of the semantic versioning system to record changes to the library.

- Major increments represent a rework or a revamp of the library.
- Minor increments represent new functionality, larger API changes, and milestones/accumulations of patch increments.
- Patch increments represent bug fixes, modifications that don't directly affect users, progress towards goals, or other small changes.
